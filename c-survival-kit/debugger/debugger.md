# GDB quick tips:

 Whatever you do wrong to your code C will spit out a single error all the time
 
 That's because once the code is compiled the information about the source code is lost
 
 So the interpreter that is running your C code has no way to identify what the hell is wrong with it.
 
 For that we will need to run our compiler with a special command: `gcc -g source-file.c`
 
 This will leave information about the source code along with the compiled file.
